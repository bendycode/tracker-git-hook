h2. Example Usage

# @git commit -am "[Story467593 state:finished] My super duper comment."@
# @git push@

Story 467593 on Pivotal Tracker is now marked finished, and has "My super duper comment".  Your git commit has been tied to Pivotal Tracker just like that.

h2. Overview

Use this project so that commit messages pushed to your non-github git server automatically post as comments tied to your Pivotal Tracker stories, and can also change the state of those stories.

This is very handy way to tie your git history to your Pivotal Tracker history.

If your project lives on github, use "tracker-github-hooks":http://github.com/chris/tracker_github_hook.  If you use Lighthouse, then use "lighthouse-git-hooks":http://github.com/bkerley/lighthouse-git-hooks instead.  Those projects inspired this one, and in all honesty, this project is as much a fork of lighthouse-git-hooks as not.

If you want to use this, and desire functionality not yet in place, then fork away!  It is open source, after all.

h2. Installation and Configuration

h3. Install tracker-git-hook (One Time Only)

# log into your git server, probably as the git user, in git's home directory
# @git clone git://github.com/bendycode/tracker-git-hook.git@
# @cd tracker-git-hook@
# @export TRACKER_GIT_HOOK_HOME=$(pwd)@
# @git submodule init@
# @git submodule update@

h3. Configure a project

# cd into your project's hook directory
** For me, this was in ~git/repositories/project_name/hooks
# @cp $TRACKER_GIT_HOOK_HOME/hooks/post-receive ./@
# edit the new copy of post-receive:
** set TRACKER_GIT_HOOK_HOME to the same directory you set it to when installing tracker-git-hook above.
** set your PROJECT_NAME
# @cd $TRACKER_GIT_HOOK_HOME/project_configs@
# @cp -r sample your_project_name@
# edit your new project config directory.
** Note that I have set .gitignore to keep your (and my) project config settings out of github.
